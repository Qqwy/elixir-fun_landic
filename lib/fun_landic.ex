  Under FunLandic, you can find many practical implementations of different Algebraic Data Types:

  - The `Maybe` CombinableMonad, which you can use for safe failure handling.

  The following are TODO:
  Combinables:
 
  - The `Sum` and `Product` Combinables to easily calculate numerical sums/products.
  - The `Any` and `All` Combinables to easily calculate boolean predicates.
  - The 

  Monads:
 
  - Tree
  - Either
  - Reader
  - Writer

  Foldables

  - Sets (MapSet impl)
